# AnagramsGrouping

This project provides a function to group a list of words into sets of anagrams.Anagram grouping refers to the process of categorizing words or strings into groups based on whether they are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase.

When we perform anagram grouping, we look for words or strings that contain the same set of characters, but in a different order. These words or strings are considered anagrams of each other. By grouping them together, we can identify and organize sets of words or strings that share the same set of characters, making it easier to analyze or process them collectively.

For example, consider the words "cat," "tac," and "act." These words are anagrams of each other because they contain the same characters (c, a, and t), just in different orders. By grouping them together, we can identify that they are related and share a common set of letters.

Anagram grouping can be useful in various applications, such as word games, linguistic analysis, data processing, and pattern recognition. It allows us to identify relationships and similarities between words or strings based on their character composition, enabling more efficient processing and analysis of the data.
